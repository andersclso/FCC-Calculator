# Freecodecamp Advanced Front End Development Project
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

## Project Criteria:
* User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
* User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
* User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

## Functional Additions:
* Calculator can recieve inputs from OSX and Windows keyboards (regular number keys & numpad enabled)
